# UPDATES
I‚Äôd like to start by once again saying how humbled and amazed I am at the efforts that have been put forth thus far. This announcement will serve as a reminder as well as outlining what to expect. 

- All people who reached out on Reddit asking to be involved have been sent a discord link. This could potentially add several hundred more people to our discord.
- A [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md) was written.
- An organization/hierarchy document for moderators and their responsibilities in this discord is in process; however, due to timezones, we're not able to finalize this just yet.

## **Make sure you have filled out the introduction survey to be considered in the next steps!**

- üî∂ **One-minute Survey**  about what your visions are for this project. This is the first step in taking the ideas throughout discord and narrowing it down.

- üî∂ **Introduction Survey** answering refined questions about your skill level and intended level of involvement.

The following is a brief overview of the steps I will be making to take this project from a viral Reddit post into a tangible service:

- [X] Finish inviting the ~500 people from Reddit I didn't get to yesterday

- [X] Give everyone a chance to fill out the surveys on their qualifications and vision

- [ ] Pick out the strongest technical leaders with the most experience and knowledge balanced with their willingness to be involved, reach out to them, and create appropriate roles for them. If there is any controversy here, we can vote on who these leaders should be to democratize this process. We will discuss the results of the vision survey as well.

- [ ] Get these SME/Tech/PM Stakeholders and reach out together to the people who have already started their own projects in this field and set up some meetings.

- [ ] Between our SMEs, we will decide what to keep as a base for our work from what exists already and what those authors are willing to share. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to. 

- [ ] Start the repo, and decide who from this community will be allowed to approve/merge stuff in/etc. for ongoing maintenance.

- [ ] All the eager developers begin contributing, and it becomes an open source project just like anything else out there.


## Current Goals

1) There are still over 500 people who have contacted me on Reddit who want to be involved with all sorts of valuable skills that I don‚Äôt want to miss out on. I am unfortunately still rate limited on Reddit, so I‚Äôm not able to respond directly to the ~300 chat DMs and must open up their Reddit profiles individually and send them a non-chat DM. This is time consuming, but it‚Äôs important to be done. 

2) We are assembling a team of discord moderators among the people here who have experience and have volunteered their time. We are delegating responsibilities among this group to (for the time being) ‚Äúown‚Äù certain channels such that we don‚Äôt lose any valuable information, ideas, or names of people who are actively getting more involved. This is crucial before inviting more people to this discord. Technical stakeholders and owners will be decided at a later time.

3) I will be releasing more information later today regarding a code of conduct as well as guidelines for transparency. These will be provided to you to give feedback on. In the meantime, voice any concerns you have in the questions-comments-and-concerns channel.



## Address concerns that have been raised


Regarding structure, finance, and the WSB sub-reddit, I would like to make some clarifications.

- When I initially mentioned the angel investor, I did so because I saw his enthusiasm as a testament to what potential this idea had. There were only a dozen people in the discord at the time--I had no idea how big this was going to get. After talking with the investor, I have concerns about his values. He has not been contacted since. He was never taken on, so there is no one to drop at this time. 

- If we ever reach a point where we need money--for legal fees, for servers, for hosting, etc--I hope we can achieve that through ordinary crowdsourcing means, such as a kickstarter. Any "investor" would be asked to make a contribution through those means and at best, be rewarded with a public thank you the same as a large-scale donor at the zoo would get a brick with their name on it. 

**Nothing will compromise the integrity of this project. It started, and will always be, fully in the hands of the people who are doing this for the people.**

- Unfortunately zjz hopped in the discord at probably the worst time he could have, because we weren't able to balance all the information we were getting yet. I'm no longer able to send him direct messages on discord. I have been banned from the sub-reddit. I have reached out to him in Reddit DMs attempting to clarify and apologize, but have not received a response. Other mods here are reaching out and we hope to clear up these miscommunications and are happy to work with WSB. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do as an individual until I receive a response to my DMs. I plan to reach out to him again once we have an MVP going. 

- With regards to structure--please continue to treat this project as you would if you stumbled upon a small open source project browsing gitlab in your free time. We have no reason to need funding or donations right now. These are premature conversations and will be handled as they become relevant, and they won‚Äôt be relevant until after we have actually made progress on a product itself. This will not result in a commercial entity (at least it will not as long as I have any say in that).

- Many people have reached out to me regarding similar projects that already exist. I'm keeping an ongoing list of all of these. Once we have a basic structure here, we will reach out to the owners of existing projects and see what we can do collaboratively. Personally, I don't see any need to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to. However, we still need to identify who our technical leaders will be before moving in that direction, and that's still a few days out at least.

**Thank you for your patience as we continue to get started. This is already enormous and while that means we have a lot of long-term sustainability, it means getting started is a little bit slower.**
