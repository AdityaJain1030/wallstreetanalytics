# WallStreet Analytics

Wall Street Analytics is an open source market analytics tool intended to democratize access to data, resources, and education to allow retail investors to make better informed decisions about potential market opportunities. **This tool will always be free and open source.**

## Vision Statement

On February 18th, in the "Virtual Hearing - Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide," congressional hearing, it became evident that hedge funds have already started investing exorbitant amounts of resources into data mining and analysis on stock trends in social media.

While these organizations have a significant financial advantage over average retail investors that allow them to make more educated decisions, we the people have the manpower, the expertise, and the determination to provide this same information to everyone. We will collaboratively collect and publicly disseminate the same information that hedge funds are paying for with the goal of leveling the playing field for the average retail investor.

## Joining the Conversation

There is currently a lot of excitement around this project, and a lot of different directions that people are wanting to go. As we try to get everything organized and everyone moving in one direction, most of the conversation is taking place in the WallStreet Analytics Discord channel. The link is here: https://discord.gg/xzzQE8yQ9e

For those that would prefer to continue the discussion here, we will do our best to moderate the issues pages.

If you are not in the discord, **refer to the ANNOUNCEMENTS.md page for a log of announcements.**

## What's the Plan?

Before we can start coding, we first need to get everyone on the same page. It will take a few days to get everyone moving in the same direction. If you haven't yet, please fill out the surveys below so we can get a headcount of who is interested in participating.

- [X]   ~~Finish inviting the 500 people from Reddit I didn't get to on the 18th~~

- [X]   ~~Give everyone a chance to fill out the surveys on their qualifications and vision.~~

- [X]   ~~Pick out the strongest technical leaders with the most experience and knowledge balanced with their willingness to be involved, reach out to them, and create appropriate roles for them. If there is any controversy here, we can vote on who these leaders should be to democratize this process. We will discuss the results of the vision survey as well.~~

- [ ]   Finance and PM SMEs will meet and set the requirements and scope of the project, with support and agreement of the technical SMEs.

- [ ]   SME Admins will create an official org chart.

- [ ]   SME Admins will create a code of conduct/guideline doc for SME Admins.

- [ ]   SME Admins will set contribution guidelines for the github repo.

- [ ]   SME Admins will reach out to their moderator teams and expand/reduce the size as appropriate and set expectations going forward.

- [ ]   Create an automated backup of the discord.

- [ ]   Decide on an official organization name.

- [ ]   Get these SME Admins (stakeholders) and reach out together to the people who have already started their own projects in this field and set up some meetings to discuss collaboration.

- [ ]   Between our SMEs, we will decide what to keep as a base for our work from what exists already and what those authors are willing to share. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to.

- [ ]   All the eager developers begin contributing, and it becomes an open source project just like anything else out there.

**Discord will continue to be the primary source of communication for delegating tasks, and you are strongly encouraged to join to make the most of the community.**
