# WallStreet Analytics

Wall Street Analytics is an open source market analytics tool intended to democratize access to data, resources, and education to allow retail investors to make better informed decisions about potential market opportunities.

There is currently a lot of excitement around this project, and a lot of different directions that people are wanting to go. As we try to get everything organized, and everyone moving in one direction, most of the conversation is taking place in the WallStreet Analytics Discord channel. If you do not have access to the channel, please send a message to zoox101 on GitHub or send a message to u/claireupvotes on Reddit and we will get you added as quickly as possible. For those that would prefer to continue the discussion here, we will do our best to moderate the issues pages.

## What's the Plan?

Before we can start coding, we first need to get everyone on the same page. It will take a few days to get everyone moving in the same direction. If you haven't yet, please fill out the surveys below so we can get a headcount of who is interested in participating.

1.  ~~Finish inviting the 500 people from Reddit I didn't get to yesterday (DONE!!)~~

2.  Give everyone a chance to fill out the surveys on their qualifications and vision

3.  Pick out the strongest technical leaders with the most experience and knowledge balanced with their willingness to be involved, reach out to them, and create appropriate roles for them. If there is any controversy here, we can vote on who these leaders should be to democratize this process. We will discuss the results of the vision survey as well.

4.  Get these SME/Tech/PM Stakeholders and reach out together to the people who have already started their own projects in this field and set up some meetings.

5.  Between our SMEs, we will decide what to keep as a base for our work from what exists already and what those authors are willing to share. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to.

6.  Start the repo, and decide who from this community will be allowed to approve/merge stuff in/etc. for ongoing maintenance.

7.  All the eager developers begin contributing, and it becomes an open source project just like anything else out there.

Thank you! We're aiming for Sunday at the earliest to begin reaching out to people.

## Frequently Asked Questions

_How can I help?_

Start by filling out the forms above and joining the discussion on the Discord channel. We will start reaching out to people to form teams as soon as possible.

_What is this about an angel investor?_

One of the project administrators was contacted by an angel investor shortly after the initial Reddit post gained traction. They were turned away. This is an open source project, not a startup. Private equity investments are not in line with this project's mission statement.

## Vision Statement

On February 18th, in the "Virtual Hearing - Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide," congressional hearing, it became evident that hedge funds have already started investing exorbitant amounts of resources into data mining and analysis on stock trends in social media.

While these organizations have a significant financial advantage over average retail investors that allow them to make more educated decisions, we the people have the manpower, the expertise, and the determination to provide this same information to everyone. We will collaboratively collect and publicly disseminate the same information that hedge funds are paying for with the goal of leveling the playing field for the average retail investor.
