# WALLSTREET ANALYTICS CODE OF CONDUCT

# OUR GOAL

These rules are established to help keep an inviting community while maintaining focus on the goals laid out in the vision statement. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration, transparency, and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.

# LOGS AND RECORDS

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this server. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.
RULES:

These rules have been put in place for all of us to follow. If you break these rules you will be punished. The following behaviors are not allowed:

-   Discriminatory jokes and hate speech (attacks on an individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities)
-   Making verbal abuse, insults, threats towards others, or displaying offensive, derogatory, or explicit content
-   The use of inappropriate images and language, including in a community members avatar or nickname
-   Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
-   Advertisements will result in a server mute
-   No using 3rd party software (self-bots)
-   Deliberately revealing previously private Personal Information about an individual or organization
-   Impersonating any community members including staff
-   Do not tag everyone or here
-   Only speak English (so our mods know what you're saying - this could change if we received moderator support for other languages)
-   No Illegal Activity (sharing software, insider information, etc)
-   Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

# REPORTING

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins or moderators. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

# CONSEQUENCES

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this server and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.

# SCOPE

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by WallStreet Analytics Discord. This includes, but is not limited to, the Discord server, our repositories on GitHub, and any other official platform. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

The WallStreet Analytics Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.
